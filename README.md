### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently doing a diploma of IT and learning to become a full-stack developer.

My skillsets include:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript, React, Express
- Python, Flask
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB

I am an early childhood teacher transitioning into IT as a junior web developer. In my previous experience, I have managed to engage many children with special needs in learning with my team of educators. The attentiveness, communication, and cooperation are invaluable transferrable skills , and I believe the same connecting mindset could be applied in web development.
